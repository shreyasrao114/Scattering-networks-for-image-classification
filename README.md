# Scattering-networks-for-image-classification
Scattering networks have demonstrated excellent potential for classification problems. In this project, we explore various filterbanks and incorporate them in scattering networks to classify images in the CIFAR-10 dataset. We use the PyTorch library for all our experiments.
